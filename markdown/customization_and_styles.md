### Use key word arguments for specific/individual plot customizations,<br>for example:

- display of non-trading periods (weekends, holidays, after hours trading)
- figure title
- y-axis title
- x-axis datetime format
- x-axis labels rotation
- line color for line plot
- tight_layout
- candle and line widths
